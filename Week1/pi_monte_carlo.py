	#Returns pi as calculated by summing all points within a circle of radius 1 
	#and dividing it by the total number of iterations.

	#performed for one quadrant of the circle

#################
#Version
#1.0 - Initial build of code
#1.1 - Added import division text to force float variable from division.
#      This is needed for all versions of python pre-3.0
#    - Added additional comments to program
#1.2 - Added output of data to a file 
#1.3 - Added shebang line to make the script executable
#1.4 - Replaced range with xrange to remove memory overflow at higher iterations
